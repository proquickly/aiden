**What is RAG?**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines two key components:
1. **Retrieval**: Fetching relevant information from a knowledge base or database.
2. **Generation**: Using a language model (like GPT or LLaMA) to generate a response based on the retrieved information.

RAG is used to answer questions or generate text by grounding the response in specific, relevant data. This makes it more accurate and reliable compared to a language model generating responses purely from its training data.

### Why Use RAG?

- **Improved Accuracy**: The model uses real, up-to-date information from your database.
- **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: You can provide the model with custom data (e.g., company documents, research papers).
- **Reduced Hallucination**: The model is less likely to "make up" information since it relies on retrieved data.

### How RAG Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Store your documents in a database optimized for search, like **ChromaDB**.
   - These documents are split into smaller chunks for better retrieval.

2. **Querying the Database**:
   - When a user asks a question, the system searches the database for the most relevant documents.

3. **Creating a Prompt**:
   - The retrieved documents are combined into a "context."
   - This context is added to the user's question to create a detailed prompt.

4. **Generating a Response**:
   - The prompt is sent to a language model (e.g., LLaMA, GPT) to generate a response based on the context.

### Example in Python

Here’s a simplified example based on your code:

```python
def rag_example(query, collection):
    # Step 1: Retrieve relevant documents
    results = collection.query(query_texts=[query], n_results=2)
    retrieved_docs = results['documents'][0]

    # Step 2: Create a prompt with the retrieved context
    context = "\n".join(retrieved_docs)
    prompt = f"""
    Context:
    {context}

    Question: {query}
    Answer based only on the context above.
    """

    # Step 3: Generate a response using a language model
    response = query_ollama(prompt)  # Function to call the language model
    return response
```

### When to Use RAG?

- **Customer Support**: Answering questions based on a company’s knowledge base.
- **Research Assistance**: Summarizing or answering questions from scientific papers.
- **Legal/Medical Applications**: Providing accurate responses based on domain-specific documents.

### Tools Commonly Used in RAG

1. **Database for Retrieval**:
   - **ChromaDB**: A vector database for storing and searching documents.
   - **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, or **FAISS** are alternatives.

2. **Language Models**:
   - Open-source models like **LLaMA** or **GPT-J**.
   - APIs like **OpenAI GPT** or **Anthropic Claude**.

3. **Frameworks**:
   - **LangChain**: A Python library for building RAG pipelines.

### Key Takeaways

- RAG combines **retrieval** and **generation** to create accurate, context-aware responses.
- It’s ideal for applications where the model needs to rely on specific, external data.
- Python libraries like **ChromaDB** and **requests** make it easy to implement.
